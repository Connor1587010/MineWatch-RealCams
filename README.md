# MineWatch Real Cams

üì∑ **This is NOT the real Minewatch website.**  
This is just a **recreation** made for fun, where players can choose to add cameras to their own Minecraft worlds!

You can place cameras down using custom data packs (Java) or resource packs (Bedrock). This is just for creative or roleplay use ‚Äî no actual surveillance or real network connection.
